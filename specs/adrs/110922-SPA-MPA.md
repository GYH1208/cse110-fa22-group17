# Multi page web application makes the most sense for our application

## Updated on 11/13

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding on which web application model (SPA, MPA, Both) to utilize based on their pros/cons and our needs.

## Considered Options

* Single page application (SPA)
  * Generally harder to implement (framework or router)
  * Generally better for low complexity applications (i.e. Twitter)
  * Generally easier to debug
  * Faster performance
* Multi page application (MPA)
  * Generally easier to implement (multiple html files)
  * Generally better for high complexity applications (i.e. Amazon)
  * Slower performance
* Hybrid between SPA/MPA
  * Share the pros/cons of both SPA/MPA
  * Could be confusing to implement without a set standard

## Decision Outcome

Given our current roadmap for the project, a multi page web application model would make the most sense because most group members are familiar with MPAs. In general, our application values low complexity and ease of implementation.
