# Single page web application makes the most sense for our application

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding on which web application model (SPA, MPA, Both) to utilize based on their pros/cons and our needs.

## Considered Options

* Single page application (SPA)
  * Generally easier to implement
  * Generally better for low complexity applications (i.e. Twitter)
  * Generally easier to debug
* Multi page application (MPA)
  * Generally harder to implement
  * Generally better for high complexity applications (i.e. Amazon)
* Hybrid between SPA/MPA
  * Share the pros/cons of both SPA/MPA
  * Could be confusing to implement without a set standard

## Decision Outcome

Given our current roadmap for the project, a single page web application model would make the most sense. In general, our application values low complexity and ease of implementation.
