# Sidebar is redundant

## Updated on 11/27

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding on whether we should keep the sidebar as it doesn't really serve much purpose

## Considered Options

* Keep it
  * Makes the app more complex
  * Looks nice

* Remove it
  * The links in the sidebar are kinda useless
  * Homepage and Events page serve the same purpose
  * Home button can be moved to the top of every page

## Decision Outcome

We feel that the sidebar is not really useful and is rather an unnecessary addition to the application. The only link in the sidebar that is useful is the settings page.

Settings page is removed, so sidebar is even more redundant.
