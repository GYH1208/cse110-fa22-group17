## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding on whether we are going to implement the database for storing user information

## Considered Options

* Continue Implementing
  * Make the app more fleshed out
  * Make the app more useful
  * Easier to use
  
* Stop Implementing
  * Time Constraint
  * Not required
  * Time can be better spent on other more pressing issues

## Decision Outcome

Given our current progress, we came to the conclusion that we are better off working on other core issues rather than pursuing a stretch goal that may or may not be finished in time.
